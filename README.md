# Face-Detection

This program has 2 functions. First function will detects faces from the given photos or pictures and Second function will do real time face detection with the help of your webcame.

I have comment out second function. If you want to use it simply comment out it.

Important
If you find that the system was not able to detect all the faces or the system is doing redundancy by detecting a single face multiple time. Try to tune the detectMultiScale function's minNeighbor argument by increasing or decreasing it's value. 

Note:
Make sure that OpenCV module is already installed on you PC.
